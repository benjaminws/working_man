Feature: WorkingMan actually works
In order to make it easy to start and stop work each day
I want to have WorkingMan automatically open and close my apps
So that I can be lazy

Scenario: App just runs
  When I get help for "working_man"
  Then the exit status should be 0
  And the banner should be present
  And the banner should document that this app takes options
  And the following options should be documented:
    |--version|
  And the banner should document that this app's arguments are:
    | run_type | which is required |
  
Scenario: Start work successfully with app and url
  Given a file named ".working_man.yml" with:
    """
    apps:
      - 'test -d /tmp'
    urls:
      - 'http://www.google.com'
    """
  And I run `working_man start`
  Then the output should contain "Work hard today"
  And the exit status should be 0

      - 'http://www.google.com'
